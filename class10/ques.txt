Programs for todays lab:

1. Write a C++ program to implement an array using class templates. Implement the following operations: Adding two arrays, finding the max and min in an array.

2. Write a program to sort using bubble sort by applying function templates.

3. Write a C++ program to create a class called EXPRESSION. Using appropriate member functions accepts a valid arithmetic expression. Evaluate the expression and divide the result by another variable ‘d’. throw an exception “divide by zero” if the value of d=0. Call a read function to read the ‘d’ value again. Rethrow the exception if d still contains 0.

4. Create a vehicle having a non-static data member registration number and a static data member count. Non-static member functions setregno() and getregno() are used to get and set the registration number. A static member function getVehiclecount() is used to return the number of vehicles in the garage. Use a constructor to increment the vehicle count when a vehicle is created and the destructor to decrement the count when the vehicle is destroyed.
