// 4. Create a vehicle having a non-static data member registration number and a static data member count. Non-static member functions setregno() and getregno() are used to get and set the registration number. A static member function getVehiclecount() is used to return the number of vehicles in the garage. Use a constructor to increment the vehicle count when a vehicle is created and the destructor to decrement the count when the vehicle is destroyed.
