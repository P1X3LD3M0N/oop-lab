1. Consider a class Student with marks. Compare marks of two students using comparison operators. 

2. Write a C++ program to create a class called MATRIX using a two-dimensional array of integers. Implement the following operations by overloading the operator = = which checks the compatibility of two matrices m1 and m2 to be added and subtracted. Perform the addition and subtraction by overloading the operators + and â€“ respectively. Display the results (sum matrix m3 and difference matrix m4).

3. Consider a class Date with year, month and day. Perform prefix and postfix increment operators for the Date suitably to show the new values.
