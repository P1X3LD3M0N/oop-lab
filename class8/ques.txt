1. Design a class named PersonData with the following member variables lastName, firstName,  address, city, state and phone.  Write the appropriate constructor, accessor and mutator functions for these member variables. Next, design a class named CustomerData, which is derived from the PersonData class.  The CustomerData class should have the following member variables: customerNumber, email id. The customerNumber variable will be used to hold a unique integer for each customer. 
Write appropriate constructors, accessor and mutator functions for these member variables. Demonstrate an object of the CustomerData class in a simple program. 



2. For a class Person, derived classes are Faculty, NonTeaching and OfficeStaff. Assume suitable attributes and member functions to raise the functionalities.


3. Consider a class Employee which has a derived class SalesPerson. Salesperson can further be distinguished into FullTimeSalesPerson and PartTimeSalesPerson. Assume suitable attributes and member functions to print variations in Bonus and workHrs (an attribute) for FullTimeSalesPerson and PartTimeSalesPerson.
