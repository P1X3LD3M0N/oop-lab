Given that an EMPLOYEE class contains following members: Employee Number, Employee Name, Basic, DA, IT, Net Salary. Member functions: to read the data, to calculate Net Salary and to print data members.  Write a C++ program to read the data of N employees and compute Net Salary of each employee. (Dearness Allowance (DA) = 52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) = 30% of the gross salary. Net Salary = Basic + DA - IT).

Write a C++ program to Create array of objects of class student with data members for storing his USN marks of six subjects for three tests and member functions to input display and calculate the avg marks for each subject taking best two of three marks. Write a tester program to test these classes. 


Write a C++ program to create a class called COMPLEX and implement the following overloading functions ADD that return a COMPLEX number. 
                        i. ADD (a, s2) – where a is an integer (real part) and s2 is a complex number. 
                        ii. ADD (s1, s2) – where s1 and s2 are complex numbers.
                             
Write a program to find the transpose of a matrix using friend function and with member functions to read and display the matrix.

Create a vehicle having a non-static data member registration number and a static data member count. Non-static member functions setregno() and getregno() are used to get and set the registration number. A static member function getVehiclecount() is used to return the number of vehicles in the garage. Use a constructor to increment the vehicle count when a vehicle is created and the destructor to decrement the count when the vehicle is destroyed.


Write a C++ program to create a class called MATRIX using a two-dimensional array of integers. Implement the following operations by overloading the operator = = which checks the compatibility of two matrices m1 and m2 to be added and subtracted. Perform the addition and subtraction by overloading the operators + and – respectively. Display the results (sum matrix m3 and difference matrix m4).

Design a class named PersonData with the following member variables lastName, firstName,  address, city, state and phone.  Write the appropriate constructor, accessor and mutator functions for these member variables. Next, design a class named CustomerData, which is derived from the PersonData class.  The CustomerData class should have the following member variables: customerNumber, email id. The customerNumber variable will be used to hold a unique integer for each customer. Write appropriate constructors, accessor and mutator functions for these member variables. Demonstrate an object of the CustomerData class in a simple program.
